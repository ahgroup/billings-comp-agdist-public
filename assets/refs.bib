  abstract = {Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory disease that affects million of people worldwide each year. Annual vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization with the goal of reducing influenza severity and limiting transmission through elicitation of antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. The antibody response elicited by current seasonal influenza virus vaccines is predominantly strain-specific, but pre-existing influenza virus immunity can greatly impact the serological antibody response to vaccination. However, it remains unclear how B cell memory is shaped by recurrent annual vaccination over the course of multiple seasons, especially in high-risk elderly populations. Here, we systematically profiled the B cell response in young adult (18--34 year old) and elderly (65+ year old) vaccine recipients that received annual split inactivated influenza virus vaccination for 3 consecutive seasons. Specifically, the antibody serological and memory B-cell compartments were profiled for reactivity against current and historical influenza A virus strains. Moreover, multiparametric analysis and antibody landscape profiling revealed a transient increase in strain-specific antibodies in the elderly, but with an impaired recall response of pre-existing memory B-cells, plasmablast (PB) differentiation and long-lasting serological changes. This study thoroughly profiles and compares the immune response to recurrent influenza virus vaccination in young and elderly participants unveiling the pitfalls of current influenza virus vaccines in high-risk populations.},

  abstract = {Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are typically used for comparing and characterizing influenza viruses. Data obtained from the assays (titres) are used quantitatively to determine antigenic differences between influenza strains. However, the use of these titres has been criticized as they sometimes fail to capture accurate antigenic differences between strains. Our previous analytical work revealed how antigenic and non-antigenic variables contribute to the titres. Building on this previous work, we have developed a Bayesian method for decoupling antigenic and non-antigenic contributions to the titres in this paper. We apply this method to a compendium of HI titres of influenza A (H3N2) viruses curated from 1968 to 2016. Remarkably, the results of this fit indicate that the non-antigenic variable, which is inversely correlated with viral avidity for the red blood cells used in HI assays, oscillates during the course of influenza virus evolution, with a period that corresponds roughly to the timescale on which antigenic variants replace each other. Together, the results suggest that the new Bayesian method is applicable to the analysis of long-term dynamics of both antigenic and non-antigenic properties of influenza virus.},

  abstract = {Each person has a unique immune history to past influenza virus infections. Exposure to influenza viruses early in life establishes memory B cell populations that influence future immune responses to influenza vaccination. Current influenza vaccines elicit antibodies that are typically strain specific and do not offer broad protection against antigenically drifted influenza strains in all age groups of people. This is particularly true for vaccine antigens of the A(H3N2) influenza virus subtype, where continual antigenic drift necessitates frequent vaccine reformulation. Broadly-reactive influenza virus vaccine antigens offer a solution to combat antigenic drift, but they also need to be equally effective in all populations, regardless of prior influenza virus exposure history. This study examined the role that pre-existing immunity plays on influenza virus vaccination. Ferrets were infected with historical A(H3N2) influenza viruses isolated from either the 1970's, 1980's, or 1990's and then vaccinated with computationally optimized broadly reactive antigens (COBRA) or wild-type (WT) influenza virus like particles (VLPs) expressing hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine antigens to examine the expansion of immune breadth. Vaccines with the H3 COBRA HA antigens had more cross-reactive antibodies following a single vaccination in all three pre-immune regimens than vaccines with WT H3 HA antigens against historical, contemporary, and future drifted A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The H3 COBRA HA vaccines also induced antibodies capable of neutralizing live virus infections against modern drifted A(H3N2) strains at higher titers than the WT H3 HA vaccine comparators.},

  abstract = {Human antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus is limited by antigenic drift resulting from amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain. Glycan addition can cause large antigenic changes but is limited by fitness costs to viral replication. Here, we report that glycans are added to H1 and H3 HAs at discrete 5-to-7-year intervals, until they reach a functional glycan limit, after which glycans are swapped at approximately 2-fold-longer intervals. Consistent with this pattern, 2009 pandemic H1N1 added a glycan at residue N162 over the 2015-2016 season, an addition that required two epistatic HA head mutations for complete glycosylation. These strains rapidly replaced H1N1 strains globally, by 2017 dominating H3N2 and influenza B virus strains for the season. The pattern of glycan modulation that we outline should aid efforts for tracing the epidemic potential of evolving human IAV strains.IMPORTANCE Frequent mutation of its major antibody target, the glycoprotein hemagglutinin, ensures that the influenza virus is perennially both a rapidly emerging virus and a major threat to public health. One type of mutation escapes immunity by adding a glycan onto an area of hemagglutinin that many antibodies recognize. This study revealed that these glycan changes follow a simple temporal pattern. Every 5 to 7 years, hemagglutinin adds a new glycan, up to a limit. After this limit is reached, no net additions of glycans occur. Instead, glycans are swapped or lost at longer intervals. Eventually, a pandemic replaces the terminally glycosylated hemagglutinin with a minimally glycosylated one from the animal reservoir, restarting the cycle. This pattern suggests the following: (i) some hemagglutinins are evolved for this decades-long process, which is both defined by and limited by successive glycan addition; and (ii) hemagglutinin's antibody dominance and its capacity for mutations are highly adapted features that allow influenza to outpace our antibody-based immunity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ease at which influenza virus sequence data can be used to estimate antigenic relationships between strains and the existence of databases containing sequence data for hundreds of thousands influenza strains make sequence-based antigenic distance estimates an attractive approach to researchers. Antigenic mismatch between circulating strains and vaccine strains results in significantly decreased vaccine effectiveness. Furthermore, antigenic relatedness between the vaccine strain and the strains an individual was originally primed with can affect the cross-reactivity of the antibody response. Thus, understanding the antigenic relationships between influenza viruses that have circulated is important to both vaccinologists and immunologists. RESULTS: Here we develop a method of mapping antigenic relationships between influenza virus stains using a sequence-based antigenic distance approach (SBM). We used a modified version of the p-all-epitope sequence-based antigenic distance calculation, which determines the antigenic relatedness between strains using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) genetic coding sequence data and provide experimental validation of the p-all-epitope calculation. We calculated the antigenic distance between 4838 H1N1 viruses isolated from infected humans between 1918 and 2016. We demonstrate, for the first time, that sequence-based antigenic distances of H1N1 Influenza viruses can be accurately represented in 2-dimenstional antigenic cartography using classic multidimensional scaling. Additionally, the model correctly predicted decreases in cross-reactive antibody levels with 87\% accuracy and was highly reproducible with even when small numbers of sequences were used. CONCLUSION: This work provides a highly accurate and precise bioinformatics tool that can be used to assess immune risk as well as design optimized vaccination strategies. SBM accurately estimated the antigenic relationship between strains using HA sequence data. Antigenic maps of H1N1 virus strains reveal that strains cluster antigenically similar to what has been reported for H3N2 viruses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that genetic variation differs across antigenic sites and discuss the implications.},

  abstract = {Background: In 2009, a novel influenza vaccine was distributed worldwide to combat the H1N1 influenza ``swine flu'' pandemic. However, antibodies induced by the vaccine display differences in their specificity and cross-reactivity dependent on pre-existing immunity. Here, we present a computational model that can capture the effect of pre-existing immunity on influenza vaccine responses. The model predicts the region of the virus hemagglutinin (HA) protein targeted by antibodies after vaccination as well as the level of cross-reactivity induced by the vaccine. We tested our model by simulating a scenario similar to the 2009 pandemic vaccine and compared the results to antibody binding data obtained from human subjects vaccinated with the monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. Results: We found that both specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies induced by the 2009 H1N1 influenza HA protein were affected by the viral strain the individual was originally exposed. Specifically, the level of antigenic relatedness between the original exposure HA antigen and the 2009 HA protein affected antigenic-site immunodominance. Moreover, antibody cross-reactivity was increased when the individual's pre-existing immunity was specific to an HA protein antigenically distinct from the 2009 pandemic strain. Comparison of simulation data with antibody binding data from human serum samples demonstrated qualitative and quantitative similarities between the model and real-life immune responses to the 2009 vaccine. Conclusion: We provide a novel method to evaluate expected outcomes in antibody specificity and cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination in individuals with different influenza HA antigen exposure histories. The model produced similar outcomes as what has been previously reported in humans after receiving the 2009 influenza pandemic vaccine. Our results suggest that differences in cross-reactivity after influenza vaccination should be expected in individuals with different exposure histories.},

We ask whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Understanding antigenic evolution through cross-reactivity assays is crucial for tracking rapidly evolving pathogens requiring regular vaccine updates. However, existing cartography methods, commonly based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), face significant challenges with sparse and complex data, producing incomplete and inconsistent maps. There is an urgent need for robust computational methods that can accurately map antigenic relationships from incomplete experimental data while maintaining biological relevance, especially given that more than 95\% of possible measurements could be missing in large-scale studies. RESULTS: We present Topolow, an algorithm that transforms cross-reactivity and binding affinity measurements into accurate positions in a phenotype space. Using a physics-inspired model, Topolow achieved comparable prediction accuracy to MDS for H3N2 influenza and 56\% and 41\% improved accuracy for Dengue and HIV, while maintaining complete positioning of all antigens. The method effectively reduces experimental noise and bias, determines optimal dimensionality through likelihood-based estimation, avoiding distortions due to insufficient dimensions, and demonstrates orders of magnitude better stability across multiple runs. We also introduce antigenic velocity vectors, which measure the rate of antigenic advancement of each isolate per unit of time against its temporal and evolutionary related background, revealing the underlying antigenic relationships and cluster transitions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Topolow is implemented in R and freely available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15620983] and [https://github.com/omid-arhami/topolow].

The impact of memory induced by prior infection is rarely considered and is difficult to ascertain, because infections are often subclinical.

The primary outcome was the effect of prior influenza A(H3N2) infection on hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibody responses induced by a locally available influenza vaccine administered in November 2016. Baseline and postvaccination sera were titrated against 40 influenza A(H3N2) strains spanning 1968-2018. At each time point (baseline, day 14 and day 280), geometric mean antibody titers against 2008-2018 strains were higher among participants with recent infection (34 (29-40), 187 (154-227) and 86 (72-103)) than among participants without recent infection (19 (17-22), 91 (64-130) and 38 (30-49)).

  abstract = {North American triple reassortant swine (TRS) influenza A viruses have caused sporadic human infections since 2005, but human-to-human transmission has not been documented. These viruses have six gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS) closely related to those of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses. Therefore, understanding of these viruses' pathogenicity and transmissibility may help to identify determinants of virulence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses and to elucidate potential human health threats posed by the TRS viruses. Here we evaluated in a ferret model the pathogenicity and transmissibility of three groups of North American TRS viruses containing swine-like and/or human-like HA and NA gene segments. The study was designed only to detect informative and significant patterns in the transmissibility and pathogenicity of these three groups of viruses. We observed that irrespective of their HA and NA lineages, the TRS viruses were moderately pathogenic in ferrets and grew efficiently in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. All North American TRS viruses studied were transmitted between ferrets via direct contact. However, their transmissibility by respiratory droplets was related to their HA and NA lineages: TRS viruses with human-like HA and NA were transmitted most efficiently, those with swine-like HA and NA were transmitted minimally or not transmitted, and those with swine-like HA and human-like NA (N2) showed intermediate transmissibility. We conclude that the lineages of HA and NA may play a crucial role in the respiratory droplet transmissibility of these viruses. These findings have important implications for pandemic planning and warrant confirmation.},

Viral pathogens, such as influenza virus, exploit this capacity for evolutionary change to persist within the human population despite substantial immune pressure. Understanding the process of adaptation in these viral systems is essential to our efforts to combat infectious disease. Results Through analysis of simulated populations and sequence data from influenza A (H3N2) and measles virus, we show how phylogenetic and population genetic techniques can be used to assess the strength and temporal pattern of adaptive evolution. The action of natural selection affects the shape of the genealogical tree connecting members of an evolving population, causing deviations from the neutral expectation. The magnitude and distribution of these deviations lends insight into the historical pattern of evolution and adaptation in the viral population. We quantify the degree of ongoing adaptation in influenza and measles virus through comparison of census population size and effective population size inferred from genealogical patterns, finding a 60-fold greater deviation in influenza than in measles. We also examine the tempo of adaptation in influenza, finding evidence for both continuous and episodic change. Conclusions Our results have important consequences for understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of the influenza virus. Additionally, these general techniques may prove useful to assess the strength and pattern of adaptive evolution in a variety of evolving systems. They are especially powerful when assessing selection in fast-evolving populations, where temporal patterns become highly visible.},

Antigenic phenotype is often assessed through pairwise measurement of cross-reactivity between influenza strains using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. Here, we extend previous approaches to antigenic cartography, and simultaneously characterize antigenic and genetic evolution by modeling the diffusion of antigenic phenotype over a shared virus phylogeny. Using HI data from influenza lineages A/H3N2, A/H1N1, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata, we determine patterns of antigenic drift across viral lineages, showing that A/H3N2 evolves faster and in a more punctuated fashion than other influenza lineages. We also show that year-to-year antigenic drift appears to drive incidence patterns within each influenza lineage. This work makes possible substantial future advances in investigating the dynamics of influenza and other antigenically-variable pathogens by providing a model that intimately combines molecular and antigenic evolution.

Using data from the US Flu Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) Network (2011-2012 to 2018-2019 seasons), we found that repeat vaccinees were vaccinated earlier in a season by one week. After accounting for waning VE, repeat vaccinees were still more likely to test positive for A(H3N2) (OR=1.11, 95\%CI:1.02-1.21) but not for influenza B or A(H1N1). We found that clinical infection influenced individuals' decision to vaccinate in the following season while protecting against clinical infection of the same (sub)type. However, adjusting for recent clinical infections did not strongly influence the estimated effect of prior-season vaccination. In contrast, we found that adjusting for subclinical infection could theoretically attenuate this effect. Additional investigation is needed to determine the impact of subclinical infections on VE.},

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated promise in addressing this critical need for other pathogens because the underlying algorithms are especially well equipped to uncover complex patterns in large datasets and produce generalizable predictions for new data. As the body of research where these techniques are applied for influenza A virus phenotype prediction continues to grow, it is useful to consider the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches to understand what has prevented these models from seeing widespread use by surveillance laboratories and to identify gaps that are underexplored with this technology. Methods and Results: We present a systematic review of English literature published through 15 April 2021 of studies employing machine learning methods to generate predictions of influenza A virus phenotypes from genomic or proteomic input. Forty-nine studies were included in this review, spanning the topics of host discrimination, human adaptability, subtype and clade assignment, pandemic lineage assignment, characteristics of infection, and antiviral drug resistance. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that biases in model design and a dearth of wet laboratory follow-up may explain why these models often go underused. We, therefore, offer guidance to overcome these limitations, aid in improving predictive models of previously studied influenza A virus phenotypes, and extend those models to unexplored phenotypes in the ultimate pursuit of tools to enable the characterization of virus isolates across surveillance laboratories.},

Nanoparticle immunogens that co-display the four haemagglutinins of licensed quadrivalent influenza vaccines elicited antibody responses in several animal models against vaccine-matched strains that were equivalent to or better than commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses by targeting the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem. The combination of potent receptor-blocking and cross-reactive stem-directed antibodies induced by the nanoparticle immunogens makes them attractive candidates for a supraseasonal influenza vaccine candidate with the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines3.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses have been responsible for large losses of lives around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. Antigenic  characterization based on hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is one of the  routine procedures for influenza vaccine strain selection. However, HI assay is  only a crude experiment reflecting the antigenic correlations among testing  antigens (viruses) and reference antisera (antibodies). Moreover, antigenic  characterization is usually based on more than one HI dataset. The combination of  multiple datasets results in an incomplete HI matrix with many unobserved  entries. This paper proposes a new computational framework for constructing an  influenza antigenic cartography from this incomplete matrix, which we refer to as  Matrix Completion-Multidimensional Scaling (MC-MDS). In this approach, we first  reconstruct the HI matrices with viruses and antibodies using low-rank matrix  completion, and then generate the two-dimensional antigenic cartography using  multidimensional scaling. Moreover, for influenza HI tables with herd immunity  effect (such as those from Human influenza viruses), we propose a temporal model  to reduce the inherent temporal bias of HI tables caused by herd immunity. By  applying our method in HI datasets containing H3N2 influenza A viruses isolated  from 1968 to 2003, we identified eleven clusters of antigenic variants,  representing all major antigenic drift events in these 36 years. Our results  showed that both the completed HI matrix and the antigenic cartography obtained  via MC-MDS are useful in identifying influenza antigenic variants and thus can be  used to facilitate influenza vaccine strain selection.

Despite moving to a quadrivalent vaccine to include strains from both the B/Victoria and B/Yamagata lineages, vaccine effectiveness rates continue to be variable and low in many past seasons. To develop more effective influenza B virus vaccines, three novel IBV hemagglutinin (HA) vaccines were designed using a computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) methodology. These IBV HA proteins were expressed on the surface of a virus-like particle (VLP) and used to vaccinate ferrets that were pre-immune to historical B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineage viruses. Ferrets vaccinated with B-COBRA HA vaccines had neutralizing antibodies with high titer HAI titer against all influenza B viruses regardless of pre-immunization history. Conversely, VLPs expressing wild-type IBV HA antigens preferentially boosted titers against viruses from the same lineage and there was little-to-no seroprotective antibodies detected in ferrets with mismatched IBV pre-immune infections. Overall, a single IBV HA developed using the COBRA methodology elicited protective broadly-reactive antibodies against current and future drifted IBVs from both lineages.},

  abstract = {Participants between the ages of 10--86 years old were vaccinated with split-inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone{\textregistered}) in six consecutive influenza seasons from 2016--2017 to 2021--2022. Vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season as a result of both host immune responses as well as evolutionary changes in the influenza virus surface glycoproteins that provide challenges to vaccine manufacturers to produce more effective annual vaccines. Next generation influenza vaccines are in development and may provide protective immune responses against a broader number of influenza viruses and reduce the need for annual vaccination. An improved understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by human host immune responses in people of different ages and co-morbidities is necessary for designing the next-generation of 'universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines. Overall, pre-existing immune responses to previous influenza virus exposures, either by past infections or vaccinations, is a critical factor influencing host responses to seasonal influenza vaccination. Participants vaccinated in consecutive seasons had reduced serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity against strains included in the vaccine compared to participants that had not been vaccinated in the preceding 1--2 years prior to entering this study. The magnitude and breadth of these antibody responses were also modulated by the age of the participant. Elderly participants over 65 years of age, in general, had lower pre-existing HAI titers each season prior to vaccination with lower post-vaccination titers compared to children or young adults under the age of 35. The administration of higher doses (HD) of the split-inactivated vaccine enhanced the antibody titers in the elderly. This report showcases 6 consecutive years of antibody HAI activity in human subjects receiving seasonal split-inactivated influenza vaccine.},

  abstract = {Influenza A/H3N2 is a rapidly evolving virus which experiences major antigenic transitions every two to eight years. Anticipating the timing and outcome of transitions is critical to developing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Using a published phylodynamic model of influenza transmission, we identified indicators of future evolutionary success for an emerging antigenic cluster and quantified fundamental trade-offs in our ability to make such predictions. The eventual fate of a new cluster depends on its initial epidemiological growth rate----which is a function of mutational load and population susceptibility to the cluster----along with the variance in growth rate across co-circulating viruses. Logistic regression can predict whether a cluster at 5\% relative frequency will eventually succeed with {\textasciitilde}80\% sensitivity, providing up to eight months advance warning. As a cluster expands, the predictions improve while the lead-time for vaccine development and other interventions decreases. However, attempts to make comparable predictions from 12 years of empirical influenza surveillance data, which are far sparser and more coarse-grained, achieve only 56\% sensitivity. By expanding influenza surveillance to obtain more granular estimates of the frequencies of and population-wide susceptibility to emerging viruses, we can better anticipate major antigenic transitions. This provides added incentives for accelerating the vaccine production cycle to reduce the lead time required for strain selection.},

Despite these updates, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against H3N2-associated disease is suboptimal. Seasonal influenza vaccines primarily induce hemagglutinin-specific antibody responses. However, antibodies directed against influenza neuraminidase (NA) also contribute to protection. Here, we analysed the antigenic diversity of a panel of N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. The antigenic breadth of these NAs was determined based on the NA inhibition (NAI) of a broad panel of ferret and mouse immune sera that were raised by infection and recombinant N2 NA immunisation. This assessment allowed us to distinguish at least four antigenic groups in the N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. Computational analysis further revealed that the amino acid residues in N2 NA that have a major impact on susceptibility to NAI by immune sera are in proximity of the catalytic site. Finally, a machine learning method was developed that allowed to accurately predict the impact of mutations that are present in our N2 NA panel on NAI. These findings have important implications for the renewed interest to develop improved influenza vaccines based on the inclusion of a protective NA antigen formulation.},

  abstract = {Antigenic variation is the main immune escape mechanism for RNA viruses like influenza or SARS-CoV-2. While high mutation rates promote antigenic escape, they also induce large mutational loads and reduced fitness. It remains unclear how this cost-benefit trade-off selects the mutation rate of viruses. Using a traveling wave model for the coevolution of viruses and host immune systems in a finite population, we investigate how immunity affects the evolution of the mutation rate and other nonantigenic traits, such as virulence. We first show that the nature of the wave depends on how cross-reactive immune systems are, reconciling previous approaches. The immune-virus system behaves like a Fisher wave at low cross-reactivities, and like a fitness wave at high cross-reactivities. These regimes predict different outcomes for the evolution of nonantigenic traits. At low cross-reactivities, the evolutionarily stable strategy is to maximize the speed of the wave, implying a higher mutation rate and increased virulence. At large cross-reactivities, where our estimates place H3N2 influenza, the stable strategy is to increase the basic reproductive number, keeping the mutation rate to a minimum and virulence low.},

  abstract = {Immune memory determines infection risk and responses to future infections and vaccinations over potentially decades of life. Despite its centrality, the dynamics of memory to antigenically variable pathogens remains poorly understood. This Review examines how past exposures shape B cell responses to vaccinations with influenza and SARS-CoV-2. An overriding feature of vaccinations with these pathogens is the recall of primary responses, often termed 'imprinting' or 'original antigenic sin'. These recalled responses can inhibit the generation of new responses unless some incompletely defined conditions are met. Depending on the context, immune memory can increase or decrease the total neutralizing antibody response to variant antigens, with apparent consequences for protection. These effects are easier to measure experimentally than epidemiologically, but there is evidence that both early and recent exposures influence vaccine effectiveness. A few immunological interactions between adaptive immune responses and antigens might explain the seemingly discrepant effects of memory. Overall, the complex observations point to a need for more quantitative approaches to integrate high-dimensional immune data from populations with diverse exposure histories. Such approaches could help identify optimal vaccination strategies against antigenically diverse pathogens.},

Using the original data from our paper (made available on the corresponding author's homepage [2]) the crude odds ratio [OR] for pH1N1 infection among TIV versus placebo recipients was 3.04 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 --8.91) and the corresponding relative risk was 2.42 (95\% CI: .99 --5.95). We found that infection with seasonal influenza was associated with a reduced risk of pH1N1. This effect was statistically significant in all participants combined (Table 6 [2]) and of a similar magnitude although not statistically significant in randomized participants, possibly because of reduced power with a smaller sample size (Table 7 [2]). After adjustment for prior seasonal infection, the effect of TIV was not statistically significant with a point estimate of 2.74 (95\% CI: .84 - --8.91). Although the point estimate is large [1], we caution against overinterpretation of nonsignificant effects. The infection-block hypothesis is sufficient to explain the excess risk of pH1N1 in TIV recipients in our study.},

Each year more than 500 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine are administered around the world, with most doses being egg-grown inactivated subunit or split-virion vaccines. These vaccines tend to have moderate effectiveness against medically attended influenza for influenza A(H1N1) and influenza B, and somewhat lower for influenza A(H3N2) where differences between vaccine strains and circulating strains can occur more frequently due to antigenic drift and egg adaptations in the vaccine strains. Several enhanced influenza vaccine platforms have been developed including cell-grown antigen, the inclusion of adjuvants, or higher antigen doses, to improve immunogenicity and protection. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was unprecedented speed in development and roll-out of relatively new vaccine platforms, including mRNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines. These new platforms present opportunities to improve protection for influenza beyond existing products. Other approaches continue to be explored. Incremental improvements in influenza vaccine performance should be achievable in the short to medium term.},

  abstract = {Humans are repeatedly exposed to variants of influenza virus throughout their lifetime. As a result, preexisting influenza-specific memory B cells can dominate the response after infection or vaccination. Memory B cells recalled by adulthood exposure are largely reactive to conserved viral epitopes present in childhood strains, posing unclear consequences on the ability of B cells to adapt to and neutralize newly emerged strains. We sought to investigate the impact of preexisting immunity on generation of protective antibody responses to conserved viral epitopes upon influenza virus infection and vaccination in humans. We accomplished this by characterizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from plasmablasts, which are predominantly derived from preexisting memory B cells. We found that, whereas some influenza infection-induced mAbs bound conserved and neutralizing epitopes on the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk domain or neuraminidase, most of the mAbs elicited by infection targeted non-neutralizing epitopes on nucleoprotein and other unknown antigens. Furthermore, most infection-induced mAbs had equal or stronger affinity to childhood strains, indicating recall of memory B cells from childhood exposures. Vaccination-induced mAbs were similarly induced from past exposures and exhibited substantial breadth of viral binding, although, in contrast to infection-induced mAbs, they targeted neutralizing HA head epitopes. Last, cocktails of infection-induced mAbs displayed reduced protective ability in mice compared to vaccination-induced mAbs. These findings reveal that both preexisting immunity and exposure type shape protective antibody responses to conserved influenza virus epitopes in humans. Natural infection largely recalls cross-reactive memory B cells against non-neutralizing epitopes, whereas vaccination harnesses preexisting immunity to target protective HA epitopes.},

Given the enormous diversity of circulating virus strains and antibody responses, comprehensively testing all antibody-virus interactions is infeasible. Even within individual studies with limited panels, exhaustive testing is not always performed, and there is no common framework for combining information across studies with partially overlapping panels, especially when the assay type or host species differ. Prior studies have demonstrated that antibody-virus interactions can be characterized in a vastly simpler and lower dimensional space, suggesting that relatively few measurements could predict unmeasured antibody-virus interactions. Here, we apply matrix completion to several large-scale influenza and HIV-1 studies. We explore how prediction accuracy evolves as the number of measurements changes and approximates the number of additional measurements necessary in several highly incomplete datasets (suggesting {$\sim$}250,000 measurements could be saved). In addition, we show how the method can combine disparate datasets, even when the number of available measurements is below the theoretical limit that guarantees successful prediction. This approach can be readily generalized to other viruses or more broadly to other low-dimensional biological datasets.},

Here we develop a form of antigenic cartography called a `neutralization landscape' that visualizes and quantifies antibody--virus interactions for antibodies targeting the influenza hemagglutinin stem. This landscape transforms the potency--breadth tradeoff into a readily solvable geometry problem. With it, we decompose the collective neutralization from multiple antibodies to characterize the composition and functional properties of the stem antibodies within. Looking forward, this framework can leverage the serological assays routinely performed for influenza surveillance to analyze how an individual's antibody repertoire evolves after vaccination or infection.},

  abstract = {The international sharing of virus data is critical for protecting populations against lethal infectious disease outbreaks. Scientists must rapidly share information to assess the nature of the threat and develop new medical countermeasures. Governments need the data to trace the extent of the outbreak, initiate public health responses, and coordinate access to medicines and vaccines. Recent outbreaks suggest, however, that the sharing of such data cannot be taken for granted -- making the timely international exchange of virus data a vital global challenge. This article undertakes the first analysis of the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data as an innovative policy effort to promote the international sharing of genetic and associated influenza virus data. Based on more than 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with key informants in the international community, coupled with analysis of a wide range of primary and secondary sources, the article finds that the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data contributes to global health in at least five ways: (1) collating the most complete repository of high-quality influenza data in the world; (2) facilitating the rapid sharing of potentially pandemic virus information during recent outbreaks; (3) supporting the World Health Organization's biannual seasonal flu vaccine strain selection process; (4) developing informal mechanisms for conflict resolution around the sharing of virus data; and (5) building greater trust with several countries key to global pandemic preparedness.},

Current models focus on changes in variant frequencies without linking them to underlying transmission mechanisms of intrinsic transmissibility and immune escape. We introduce a framework connecting variant dynamics to these mechanisms, showing how host population immunity interacts with viral transmissibility and immune escape to determine relative variant fitness. We advance a selective pressure metric that provides an early signal of epidemic growth using genetic data alone, crucial with current underreporting of cases. Additionally, we show that a latent immunity space model approximates immunological distances, offering insights into population susceptibility and immune evasion. These insights refine real-time forecasting and lay the groundwork for research into the interplay between viral genetics, immunity, and epidemic growth.},

We generated antibody landscapes to study immune profiles covering 43 years of influenza A/H3N2 virus evolution for 69 individuals monitored for infection over 6 years and for 225 individuals pre- and postvaccination. Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters. These results indicate that preemptive vaccine updates may improve influenza vaccine efficacy in previously exposed individuals.},

  abstract = {Evaluation of the antigenic similarity degree between the strains of the influenza virus is highly important for vaccine production. The conventional method used to measure such a degree is related to performing the immunological assays of hemagglutinin inhibition. Namely, the antigenic distance between two strains is calculated on the basis of HI assays. Usually, such distances are visualized by using some kind of antigenic cartography method. The known drawback of the HI assay is that it is rather time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for antigenic distance approximation based on deep learning in the feature spaces induced by hemagglutinin protein sequences and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To apply a CNN to compare the protein sequences, we utilize the encoding based on the physical and chemical characteristics of amino acids. By varying (hyper)parameters of the CNN architecture design, we find the most robust network. Further, we provide insight into the relationship between approximated antigenic distance and antigenicity by evaluating the network on the HI assay database for the H1N1 subtype. The results indicate that the best-trained network gives a high-precision approximation for the ground-truth antigenic distances, and can be used as a good exploratory tool in practical tasks.},

In this study, we describe Novel Influenza Virus A Detector (NIAViD), an unsupervised machine learning tool, adept at identifying these transitions, using the HA1 sequence and associated physico-chemical properties. NIAViD performed with 88.9\% (95\% CI, 56.5--98.0\%) and 72.7\% (95\% CI, 43.4--90.3\%) sensitivity in training and validation, respectively, outperforming the uncalibrated null model---33.3\% (95\% CI, 12.1--64.6\%) and does not require potentially biased, time-consuming and costly laboratory assays. The pivotal role of the Boman's index, indicative of the virus's cell surface binding potential, is underscored, enhancing the precision of detecting antigenic transitions. NIAViD's efficacy is not only in identifying influenza isolates that belong to novel antigenic clusters, but also in pinpointing potential sites driving significant antigenic changes, without the reliance on explicit modelling of haemagglutinin inhibition titres. We believe this approach holds promise to augment existing surveillance networks, offering timely insights for the development of updated, effective influenza vaccines. Consequently, NIAViD, in conjunction with other resources, could be used to support surveillance efforts and inform the development of updated influenza vaccines.},

Virus characterization using first infection ferret sera indicates that escape from hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies occurs more frequently and is not coordinated with escape from neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibodies.

Lau, et al., mBio 14:e00084-23, 2023, https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00084-23) is how this translates to humans who encounter multiple influenza viruses throughout life. Their cross-sectional study, using sera from a wide age range of participants and H1N1 viruses spanning 1977-2015, indicates that NI antibodies are more broadly cross-reactive than HI antibodies. Both HI and NI titers were highest against strains encountered in childhood indicating that both are shaped by priming exposures.

  abstract = {Propagation of human influenza viruses in embryonated chicken eggs (CE) results in the selection of variants with amino acid substitutions near the receptor-binding site of the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule. To evaluate the mechanisms by which these substitutions enable human virus growth in CE, we studied the binding of 10 human influenza A (H1N1, H3N2) and B strains, isolated and propagated solely in MDCK cells, and of their egg-adapted counterparts to preparations of cellular membranes, gangliosides, sialylglycoproteins, and sialyloligosaccharides. All egg-adapted variants differed from nonadapted strains by increased binding to the plasma membranes of chorio-allantoic (CAM) cells of CE and by the ability to bind to CAM gangliosides. In addition, there was no decrease in affinity for inhibitors within allantoic fluid. These findings indicate that growth of human influenza viruses in CE is restricted because of their inefficient binding to receptors on CAM cells and that gangliosides can play an important role in virus binding and/or penetration. The effects of the egg-adaptation substitutions on the receptor-binding properties of the viruses include (i) enhancement of virus binding to the terminal Sia({$\alpha$}2--3)Gal determinant (substitutions in HA positions 190, 225 of H1N1 strains and in position 186 of H3N2 strains); (ii) a decrease of steric interference with more distant parts of the Sia({$\alpha$}2--3Gal)-containing receptors (a loss of glycosylation sites in positions 163 of H1 HA and 187 of type B HA); and (iii) enhanced ionic interactions with the negatively charged molecules due to charged substitutions at the tip of the HA [187, 189, 190 (H1), and 145, 156 (H3)]. Concomitantly with enhanced binding to Sia({$\alpha$}2--3)Gal-terminated receptors, all egg-adapted variants decreased their affinity for equine macroglobulin, a glycoprotein bearing terminal 6{$\prime$}-sialyl(N-acetyllactosamine)-moieties.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Statistical modeling shows that protective HA imprinting is the crucial explanatory factor, and it provides 75\% protection against severe infection and 80\% protection against death for both H5N1 and H7N9. Our results enable us to predict age distributions of severe disease for future pandemics and demonstrate that a novel strain's pandemic potential increases yearly when a group-mismatched HA subtype dominates seasonal influenza circulation. These findings open new frontiers for rational pandemic risk assessment.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This problem of ``doing things right'' on a large scale is not essentially new; in a telephone central office, for example, a very large number of operations are performed while the errors leading to wrong numbers are kept well under control, though they have not been completely eliminated. This has been achieved, in part, through the use of self-checking circuits. The occasional failure that escapes routine checking is still detected by the customer and will, if it persists, result in customer complaint, while if it is transient it will produce only occasional wrong numbers. At the same time the rest of the central office functions satisfactorily. In a digital computer, on the other hand, a single failure usually means the complete failure, in the sense that if it is detected no more computing can be done until the failure is located and corrected, while if it escapes detection then it invalidates all subsequent operations of the machine. Put in other words, in a telephone central office there are a number of parallel paths which are more or less independent of each other; in a digital machine there is usually a single long path which passes through the same piece of equipment many, many times before the answer is obtained.},

Time-consuming, costly and middle-throughput serologic methods using virus isolates are routinely used to identify influenza antigenic variants for vaccine strain selection. However, the resulting data are notoriously noisy and difficult to interpret and integrate because of variations in reagents, supplies and protocol implementation. A novel method without such limitations is needed for antigenic variant identification.We developed a Graph-Guided Multi-Task Sparse Learning (GG-MTSL) model that uses multi-sourced serologic data to learn antigenicity-associated mutations and infer antigenic variants. By applying GG-MTSL to influenza H3N2 hemagglutinin sequences, we showed the method enables rapid characterization of antigenic profiles and identification of antigenic variants in real time and on a large scale. Furthermore, sequences can be generated directly by using clinical samples, thus minimizing biases due to culture-adapted mutation during virus isolation.MATLAB source codes developed for GG-MTSL are available through http://sysbio.cvm.msstate.edu/files/GG-MTSL/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Identification of emerging antigenic variants among circulating influenza viruses is critical to the vaccine virus selection process, with vaccine effectiveness maximized when constituents are antigenically similar to circulating viruses. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data are commonly used to assess influenza antigenicity. Here, sequence and 3-D structural information of hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins were analyzed together with corresponding HI assay data for former seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus isolates (1997-2009) and reference viruses. The models developed identify and quantify the impact of eighteen amino acid substitutions on the antigenicity of HA, two of which were responsible for major transitions in antigenic phenotype. We used reverse genetics to demonstrate the causal effect on antigenicity for a subset of these substitutions. Information on the impact of substitutions allowed us to predict antigenic phenotypes of emerging viruses directly from HA gene sequence data and accuracy was doubled by including all substitutions causing antigenic changes over a model incorporating only the substitutions with the largest impact. The ability to quantify the phenotypic impact of specific amino acid substitutions should help refine emerging techniques that predict the evolution of virus populations from one year to the next, leading to stronger theoretical foundations for selection of candidate vaccine viruses. These techniques have great potential to be extended to other antigenically variable pathogens.},

  abstract = {Surface antigens of pathogens are commonly targeted by vaccine-elicited antibodies but antigenic variability, notably in RNA viruses such as influenza, HIV and SARS-CoV-2, pose challenges for control by vaccination. For example, influenza A(H3N2) entered the human population in 1968 causing a pandemic and has since been monitored, along with other seasonal influenza viruses, for the emergence of antigenic drift variants through intensive global surveillance and laboratory characterisation. Statistical models of the relationship between genetic differences among viruses and their antigenic similarity provide useful information to inform vaccine development, though accurate identification of causative mutations is complicated by highly correlated genetic signals that arise due to the evolutionary process. Here, using a sparse hierarchical Bayesian analogue of an experimentally validated model for integrating genetic and antigenic data, we identify the genetic changes in influenza A(H3N2) virus that underpin antigenic drift. We show that incorporating protein structural data into variable selection helps resolve ambiguities arising due to correlated signals, with the proportion of variables representing haemagglutinin positions decisively included, or excluded, increased from 59.8\% to 72.4\%. The accuracy of variable selection judged by proximity to experimentally determined antigenic sites was improved simultaneously. Structure-guided variable selection thus improves confidence in the identification of genetic explanations of antigenic variation and we also show that prioritising the identification of causative mutations is not detrimental to the predictive capability of the analysis. Indeed, incorporating structural information into variable selection resulted in a model that could more accurately predict antigenic assay titres for phenotypically-uncharacterised virus from genetic sequence. Combined, these analyses have the potential to inform choices of reference viruses, the targeting of laboratory assays, and predictions of the evolutionary success of different genotypes, and can therefore be used to inform vaccine selection processes.},

  abstract = {The strength and breadth of an individual's antibody repertoire is an important predictor of their response to influenza infection or vaccination. Although progress has been made in understanding qualitatively how repeated exposures shape the antibody mediated immune response, quantitative understanding remains limited. We developed a set of mathematical models describing short-term antibody kinetics following influenza infection or vaccination and fit them to haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres from 5 groups of ferrets which were exposed to different combinations of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV with or without adjuvant), A/H3N2 priming inoculation and post-vaccination A/H1N1 inoculation. We fit models with various immunological mechanisms that have been empirically observed but have not previously been included in mathematical models of antibody landscapes, including: titre ceiling effects, antigenic seniority and exposure-type specific cross reactivity. Based on the parameter estimates of the best supported models, we describe a number of key immunological features. We found quantifiable differences in the degree of homologous and cross-reactive antibody boosting elicited by different exposure types. Infection and adjuvanted vaccination generally resulted in strong, broadly reactive responses whereas unadjuvanted vaccination resulted in a weak, narrow response. We found that the order of exposure mattered: priming with A/H3N2 improved subsequent vaccine response, and the second dose of adjuvanted vaccination resulted in substantially greater antibody boosting than the first. Either antigenic seniority or a titre ceiling effect were included in the two best fitting models, suggesting a role for a mechanism describing diminishing antibody boosting with repeated exposures. Although there was considerable uncertainty in our estimates of antibody waning parameters, our results suggest that both short and long term waning were present and would be identifiable with a larger set of experiments. These results highlight the potential use of repeat exposure animal models in revealing short-term, strain-specific immune dynamics of influenza., Despite most individuals having some preexisting immunity from past influenza infections and vaccinations, a significant proportion of the human population is infected with influenza each year. Predicting how an individual's antibody profile will change following exposure is therefore useful for evaluating which populations are at greatest risk and how effective vaccination strategies might be. However, interpretation of antibody data from humans is complicated by immunological interactions between all previous, unobserved exposures in an individual's life. We developed a mathematical model to describe short-term antibody kinetics that are important in building an individual's immune profile but are difficult to observe in human populations. We validated this model using antibody data from ferrets with known, varied infection and vaccination histories. We were able to quantify the independent contributions of various exposures and immunological mechanisms in generating observed antibody titres. These results suggest that data from experimental systems may be included in models of human antibody dynamics, which may improve predictions of vaccination strategy effectiveness and how population susceptibility changes over time.},

Analyzing a panel of monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin escape mutants revealed a positive correlation between receptor binding avidity and escape from polyclonal antibodies.

Meanwhile, influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequences are also effective in inferring antigenic distances. Thus, it is natural to integrate HA protein sequence information into low-rank matrix completion model to help infer influenza antigenicity, which is critical to influenza vaccine development.We have proposed a novel algorithm called biological matrix completion with side information (BMCSI), which first measures HA protein sequence similarities among influenza viruses (especially on epitopes) and then integrates the similarity information into a low-rank matrix completion model to predict influenza antigenicity. This algorithm exploits both the correlations among viruses and vaccines in serological tests and the power of HA sequence in predicting influenza antigenicity. We applied this model into H3N2 seasonal influenza virus data. Comparing to previous methods, we significantly reduced the prediction root-mean-square error in a 10-fold cross validation analysis. Based on the cartographies constructed from imputed data, we showed that the antigenic evolution of H3N2 seasonal influenza is generally S-shaped while the genetic evolution is half-circle shaped. We also showed that the Spearman correlation between genetic and antigenic distances (among antigenic clusters) is 0.83, demonstrating a globally high correspondence and some local discrepancies between influenza genetic and antigenic evolution. Finally, we showed that 4.4\%{\textpm}1.2\% genetic variance (corresponding to 3.11\,{\textpm}\,1.08 antigenic distances) caused an antigenic drift event for H3N2 influenza viruses historically.The software and data for this study are available at http://bi.sky.zstu.edu.cn/BMCSI/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the antigenic differences of major H7 strains with an ultimate aim to discover H7 HA proteins that can elicit protective receptor-binding antibodies against co-circulating H7 influenza strains. METHOD: A panel of eight H7 influenza strains were selected from 3,633 H7 HA amino acid sequences identified over the past two decades (2000-2018). The sequences were expressed on the surface of virus like particles (VLPs) and used to vaccinate C57BL/6 mice. Serum samples were collected and tested for hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity. The vaccinated mice were challenged with lethal dose of H7N9 virus, A/Anhui/1/2013. RESULTS: VLPs expressing the H7 HA antigens elicited broadly reactive antibodies each of the selected H7 HAs, except the A/Turkey/Italy/589/2000 (Italy/00) H7 HA. A putative glycosylation due to an A169T substitution in antigenic site B was identified as a unique antigenic profile of Italy/00. Introduction of the putative glycosylation site (H7 HA-A169T) significantly altered the antigenic profile of HA of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain. CONCLUSION: This study identified key amino acid mutations that result in severe vaccine mismatches for future H7 epidemics. Future universal influenza vaccine candidates will need to focus on viral variants with these key mutations.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses rapidly evolve to evade previously acquired human immunity. Maintaining vaccine efficacy necessitates continuous monitoring of antigenic differences among strains. Traditional serological methods for assessing these differences are labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need for efficient computational approaches. This paper proposes MetaFluAD, a meta-learning-based method designed to predict quantitative antigenic distances among strains. This method models antigenic relationships between strains, represented by their hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, as a weighted attributed network. Employing a graph neural network (GNN)-based encoder combined with a robust meta-learning framework, MetaFluAD learns comprehensive strain representations within a unified space encompassing both antigenic and genetic features. Furthermore, the meta-learning framework enables knowledge transfer across different influenza subtypes, allowing MetaFluAD to achieve remarkable performance with limited data. MetaFluAD demonstrates excellent performance and overall robustness across various influenza subtypes, including A/H3N2, A/H1N1, A/H5N1, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata. MetaFluAD synthesizes the strengths of GNN-based encoding and meta-learning to offer a promising approach for accurate antigenic distance prediction. Additionally, MetaFluAD can effectively identify dominant antigenic clusters within seasonal influenza viruses, aiding in the development of effective vaccines and efficient monitoring of viral evolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccines require annual readministration; however, several reports have suggested that repeated vaccination might attenuate the vaccine's effectiveness. We aimed to estimate the reduction in vaccine effectiveness associated with repeated influenza vaccination. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Complete databases for articles published from Jan 1, 2016, to June 13, 2022, and Web of Science for studies published from database inception to June 13, 2022. For studies published before Jan 1, 2016, we consulted published systematic reviews. Two reviewers (EJ-G and EJR) independently screened, extracted data using a data collection form, assessed studies' risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) and evaluated the weight of evidence by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We included observational studies and randomised controlled trials that reported vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), or influenza B using four vaccination groups: current season; previous season; current and previous seasons; and neither season (reference). For each study, we calculated the absolute difference in vaccine effectiveness ({$\Delta$}VE) for current season only and previous season only versus current and previous season vaccination to estimate attenuation associated with repeated vaccination. Pooled vaccine effectiveness and ∆VE were calculated by season, age group, and overall. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021260242. FINDINGS: We identified 4979 publications, selected 681 for full review, and included 83 in the systematic review and 41 in meta-analyses. {$\Delta$}VE for vaccination in both seasons compared with the current season was -9\% (95\% CI -16 to -1, I2=0\%; low certainty) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, -18\% (-26 to -11, I2=7\%; low certainty) for influenza A(H3N2), and -7\% (-14 to 0, I2=0\%; low certainty) for influenza B, indicating lower protection with consecutive vaccination. However, for all types, A subtypes and B lineages, vaccination in both seasons afforded better protection than not being vaccinated. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates suggest that, although vaccination in the previous year attenuates vaccine effectiveness, vaccination in two consecutive years provides better protection than does no vaccination. The estimated effects of vaccination in the previous year are concerning and warrant additional investigation, but are not consistent or severe enough to support an alternative vaccination regimen at this time.

  abstract = {Numerous modern technological and scientific advances have changed the vaccine industry. However, nearly 70 years of influenza vaccine usage have passed without substantial changes in the underlying principles of the vaccine. The challenge of vaccinating against influenza lies in the constantly changing nature of the virus itself. Influenza viruses undergo antigenic evolution through antigenic drift and shift in their surface glycoproteins. This has forced frequent updates of vaccine antigens to ensure that the somewhat narrowly focused vaccine-induced immune responses defend against circulating strains. Few vaccine production systems have been developed that can entertain such constant changes. Although influenza virus infection induces long-lived immunologic memory to the same or similar strains, most people do not encounter the same strain repeatedly in their lifespan, suggesting that enhancement of natural immunity is required to improve influenza vaccines. It is clear that transformative change of influenza vaccines requires a rethink of how we immunize. In this study, we review the problems associated with the changing nature of the virus, and highlight some of the approaches being employed to improve influenza vaccines.},

This means that a person with antibodies well tuned to an initial infection will not be protected against the same virus years later and that vaccine-mediated protection will decay. To expand our understanding of which endemic human viruses evolve in this fashion, we assess adaptive evolution across the genome of 28 endemic viruses spanning a wide range of viral families and transmission modes. Surface proteins consistently show the highest rates of adaptation, and ten viruses in this panel are estimated to undergo antigenic evolution to selectively fix mutations that enable the escape of prior immunity. Thus, antibody evasion is not an uncommon evolutionary strategy among human viruses, and monitoring this evolution will inform future vaccine efforts. Additionally, by comparing overall amino acid substitution rates, we show that SARS-CoV2 is accumulating protein-coding changes at substantially faster rates than endemic viruses.},

From 1968 to 2003, antigenic change was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only seven positions in HA immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Most of these substitutions were involved in antigenic change more than once. Equivalent positions were responsible for the recent antigenic changes of influenza B and A/H1N1 viruses. Substitution of a single amino acid at one of these positions substantially changed the virus-specific antibody response in infected ferrets. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that govern influenza viruses.},

By introducing an epidemiological model that allows for differences between the genetic and antigenic properties of the virus's hemagglutinin, we show that these patterns can arise from cluster-specific immunity alone. Central to the formulation is a genotype-to-phenotype mapping, based on neutral networks, with antigenic phenotypes, not genotypes, determining the degree of strain cross-immunity. The model parsimoniously explains well-known, as well as previously unremarked, features of interpandemic influenza dynamics and evolution. It captures the observed boom-and-bust pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis during which genetic diversity grows, and with episodic contraction of this diversity during cluster transitions.},

Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in {\textasciitilde}1 billion infections, 3--5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000--500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-existing immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in\,{$>$}40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.},

As seen with influenza type A viruses, antigenic drift in influenza B viruses proceeds mostly through the accumulation of amino acid substitutions within the HA1 portion of the HA molecule. However, the rate of variation observed among the influenza B virus HAs appears to be significantly lower than the observed rate of variation among influenza A virus HAs. The overall rate of amino acid change in the HA1s of the influenza B viruses studied is 2\% per 10 years, whereas the HA1s of H3 influenza A viruses vary by 9.2\% per 10 years. The sequences of the influenza B HAs were also examined in relation to the three-dimensional model for the A/Aichi/2/68 HA. When the primary amino acid sequences are compared, it appears that most of the important structural features of the type A HAs--such as the sialic acid binding site, the disulfide linkages, and the stem structure of the trimer--are conserved in the influenza B virus HAs. Regions are also identified where extensive amino acid substitutions have occurred among the three antigenically distinct influenza B virus HAs. The locations of these areas in the B HA structure correspond to antigenic regions proposed for the A virus HAs. In addition, modulation of antigenic regions in B virus HAs may also occur through amino acid deletions and variation in glycosylation sites.},

  abstract = {The immunity of a host population against specific influenza A strains can influence a number of important biological processes, from the emergence of new virus strains to the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. However, the development of an individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza A over the course of a lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza A(H3N2) in southern China. We found that "antigenic seniority" and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed neutralisation titres to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. By establishing what are likely to be important mechanisms driving epochal trends in population immunity, we also identified key directions for future studies. In particular, our results highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast, transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune responses considered here.},

  abstract = {Shape space was proposed over 20 years ago as a conceptual formalism in which to represent antibody/antigen binding. It has since played a key role in computational immunology. Antigens and antibodies are considered to be points in an abstract "shape space", where coordinates of points in this space represent generalized physico-chemical properties associated with various (unspecified) physical properties related to binding, such as geometric shape, hydrophobicity, charge, etc. Distances in shape space between points representing antibodies and (the shape complement) of antigens are assumed to be related to their affinity, with small distances corresponding to high affinity. In this paper, we provide algorithms, related to metric and ordinal multidimensional scaling algorithms first developed in the mathematical psychology literature, which construct explicit, quantitative coordinates for points in shape space given experimental data such as hemagglutination inhibition assays, or other general affinity assays. Previously, such coordinates had been conceptual constructs and totally implicit. The dimension of shape space deduced from hemagglutination inhibition assays for influenza is low, approximately five dimensional. The deduction of the explicit geometry of shape space given experimental affinity data provides new ways to quantify the similarity of antibodies to antibodies, antigens to antigens, and the affinity of antigens to antibodies. This has potential utility in, e.g. strain selection decisions for annual influenza vaccines, among other applications. The analysis techniques presented here are not restricted to the analysis of antibody-antigen interactions and are generally applicable to affinity data resulting from binding assays.},

Thus, linking the genetic composition of circulating viruses and the serological experimental results measuring antibody efficacy is crucial to the vaccine design decision. Historically, genetic and serological data have been presented separately in the form of static visualizations of phylogenetic trees and tabular serological results to identify vaccine candidates. To simplify this decision-making process, we have created an interactive tool for visualizing serological data that has been integrated into Nextstrain's real-time phylogenetic visualization framework, Auspice. We show how the combined interactive visualizations may be used by decision makers to explore the relationships between complex data sets for both prospective vaccine virus selection and retrospectively exploring the performance of vaccine viruses.},

Here we present phylowave,~a scalable approach that summarizes changes in population composition in phylogenetic trees, enabling the automatic detection of lineages based on shared fitness and evolutionary relationships. We use our approach on a broad set of viruses and bacteria (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A subtype H3N2, Bordetella pertussis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis), which include both well-studied and understudied threats to human health. We show that phylowave recovers the main known circulating lineages for each pathogen and that it can detect specific amino acid changes linked to fitness changes. Furthermore, phylowave identifies previously undetected lineages with increased fitness, including three co-circulating B.\,pertussis lineages. Inference using phylowave is robust to uneven and limited observations. This widely applicable approach provides an avenue to monitor evolution in real time to support public-health action and explore fundamental drivers of pathogen fitness.},

  abstract = {We have previously shown that broadly neutralizing antibodies reactive to the conserved stem region of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) were generated in people infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. Such antibodies are rarely seen in humans following infection or vaccination with seasonal influenza virus strains. However, the important question remained whether the inactivated 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine, like the infection, could also induce these broadly neutralizing antibodies. To address this question, we analyzed B-cell responses in 24 healthy adults immunized with the pandemic vaccine in 2009. In all cases, we found a rapid, predominantly IgG-producing vaccine-specific plasmablast response. Strikingly, the majority (25 of 28) of HA-specific monoclonal antibodies generated from the vaccine-specific plasmablasts neutralized more than one influenza strain and exhibited high levels of somatic hypermutation, suggesting they were derived from recall of B-cell memory. Indeed, memory B cells that recognized the 2009 pandemic H1N1 HA were detectable before vaccination not only in this cohort but also in samples obtained before the emergence of the pandemic strain. Three antibodies demonstrated extremely broad cross-reactivity and were found to bind the HA stem. Furthermore, one stem-reactive antibody recognized not only H1 and H5, but also H3 influenza viruses. This exceptional cross-reactivity indicates that antibodies capable of neutralizing most influenza subtypes might indeed be elicited by vaccination. The challenge now is to improve upon this result and design influenza vaccines that can elicit these broadly cross-reactive antibodies at sufficiently high levels to provide heterosubtypic protection.},

A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.},

Relative VE was estimated against general practitioner-diagnosed influenza-like illnesses (GP-ILI) and medically attended acute respiratory illnesses (MAARI) among participants who have been repeatedly vaccinated compared with first-time vaccinees using proportional hazards models. Relative VE against MAARI may be reduced for individuals above 65 years old who were vaccinated in the current and previous influenza seasons for some influenza seasons.

  abstract = {Influenza infections result in considerable public health and economic impacts each year. One of the contributing factors to the high annual incidence of human influenza is the virus's ability to evade acquired immunity through continual antigenic evolution. Understanding the evolutionary forces that act within and between hosts is therefore critical to interpreting past trends in influenza virus evolution and in predicting future ones. Several studies have analyzed longitudinal patterns of influenza A virus genetic diversity in natural human infections to assess the relative contributions of selection and genetic drift on within-host evolution. However, in these natural infections, within-host viral populations harbor very few single-nucleotide variants, limiting our resolution in understanding the forces acting on these populations in vivo. Furthermore, low levels of within-host viral genetic diversity limit the ability to infer the extent of drift across transmission events. Here, we propose to use influenza virus genomic diversity as an alternative signal to better understand within- and between-host patterns of viral evolution. Specifically, we focus on the dynamics of defective viral genomes (DVGs), which harbor large internal deletions in one or more of influenza virus's eight gene segments. Our longitudinal analyses of DVGs show that influenza A virus populations are highly dynamic within hosts, corroborating previous findings based on viral genetic diversity that point toward the importance of genetic drift in driving within-host viral evolution. Furthermore, our analysis of DVG populations across transmission pairs indicates that DVGs rarely appeared to be shared, indicating the presence of tight transmission bottlenecks. Our analyses demonstrate that viral genomic diversity can be used to complement analyses based on viral genetic diversity to reveal processes that drive viral evolution within and between hosts.},

Here, we isolated broad, subtype-neutralizing mAbs from human B cells targeting the H1 or H3 HA head as well as a unique mAb targeting the stem. The H1 mAbs target the previously defined lateral patch epitope on H1 HAs and recognize HAs from 1933 to 2021 in addition to a swine H1N1 virus with pandemic potential. Using directed evolution, we improved the neutralization potency of these H1 mAbs towards a contemporary H1 strain. Using deep mutational scanning of four antigenically distinct H1N1 viruses, we identified potential viral escape pathways. For the H3 mAbs we used cryo-EM to define the targeted epitopes: one mAb recognizes the side of the H3 head, accommodating the N133 glycan and a pocket underneath the receptor binding site. The other H3 mAb recognizes an epitope in the HA stem that overlaps with previously characterized mAbs, but with distinct antibody variable genes and mode of recognition. Collectively, these mAbs identify common sites recognized by broad, subtype-specific mAbs that may be elicited by next-generation vaccines.},

These changes are typically driven by adaptive mutations, particularly in the antigenic epitopes, the regions of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin targeted by human antibodies. Here we describe a consistent set of methods for data-driven predictive analysis of viral evolution. Our pipeline integrates four types of data: (1) sequence data of viral isolates collected on a worldwide scale, (2) epidemiological data on incidences, (3) antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, and (4) intrinsic viral phenotypes. From the combined analysis of these data, we obtain estimates of relative fitness for circulating strains and predictions of clade frequencies for periods of up to one year. Furthermore, we obtain comparative estimates of protection against future viral populations for candidate vaccine strains, providing a basis for pre-emptive vaccine strain selection. Continuously updated predictions obtained from the prediction pipeline for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are available on the website previr.app.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, an increasing proportion of circulating human influenza A(H3N2) viruses exhibited haemagglutination activity that was sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors. This change in haemagglutination as compared to older circulating A(H3N2) viruses prompted an investigation of the underlying molecular basis. Recent human influenza A(H3N2) viruses were found to agglutinate turkey erythrocytes in a manner that could be blocked with either oseltamivir or neuraminidase-specific antisera, indicating that agglutination was driven by neuraminidase, with a low or negligible contribution of haemagglutinin. Using representative virus recombinants it was shown that the haemagglutinin of a recent A(H3N2) virus indeed had decreased activity to agglutinate turkey erythrocytes, while its neuraminidase displayed increased haemagglutinating activity. Viruses with chimeric and mutant neuraminidases were used to identify the amino acid substitution histidine to arginine at position 150 flanking the neuraminidase catalytic site as the determinant of this neuraminidase-mediated haemagglutination. An analysis of publicly available neuraminidase gene sequences showed that viruses with histidine at position 150 were rapidly replaced by viruses with arginine at this position between 2005 and 2008, in agreement with the phenotypic data. As a consequence of neuraminidase-mediated haemagglutination of recent A(H3N2) viruses and poor haemagglutination via haemagglutinin, haemagglutination inhibition assays with A(H3N2) antisera are no longer useful to characterize the antigenic properties of the haemagglutinin of these viruses for vaccine strain selection purposes. Continuous monitoring of the evolution of these viruses and potential consequences for vaccine strain selection remains important.},

NA agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) can be inhibited by neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), thus distinguishing it from haemagglutinin (HA) binding. We wanted to know if viruses prior to 2005 can demonstrate this property. METHODS: Pairs of influenza A(H3N2) isolates ranging from 1993-2008 passaged in parallel only in eggs or in MDCK cells were tested for inhibition of haemagglutination by various NAIs. RESULTS: Only viruses isolated since 1994 and cultured in MDCK cells bound chicken RBCs solely through their NA. NAI inhibition of agglutination of turkey RBCs was seen for some, but not all of these same MDCK grown viruses. Efficacy of inhibition of enzyme activity and haemagglutination differed between NAIs. For many viruses lower concentrations of oseltamivir could inhibit agglutination compared to zanamivir, although they could both inhibit enzyme activity at comparable concentrations. An E119V mutation reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir and 4-aminoDANA for both the enzyme assay and inhibition of agglutination. Sequence analysis of the NAs and HAs of some paired viruses revealed mutations in the haemagglutinin of all egg passaged viruses. For many of the paired egg and MDCK cultured viruses we found no differences in their NA sequences by Sanger sequencing. However, deep sequencing of MDCK grown isolates revealed low levels of variant populations with mutations at either D151 or T148 in the NA, suggesting mutations at either site may be able to confer this property. CONCLUSIONS: The NA active site of MDCK cultured human influenza A(H3N2) viruses isolated since 1994 can express dual enzyme and receptor binding functions. Binding correlated with either D151 or T148 mutations. The catalytic and receptor binding sites do not appear to be structurally identical since relative concentrations of the NAIs to inhibit enzyme activity and agglutination differ.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized studies that compared the risk of MAI and ARI between subjects who had been vaccinated for two consecutive seasons (multiple vaccine group) and those who had been vaccinated in the current season and not in the previous season (single vaccine group). RESULTS: Of 1467 articles identified, eight studies covering ten seasons were included in meta-analyses. Six studies assessed efficacy against MAI in children, yielding the risk ratios (RR) of 2.04 (95\% CI 1.29-3.22) when circulating strains mismatched vaccine strains, and 0.64 (0.33-1.22) when circulating strains matched vaccine strains. When stratified by vaccine types, the reduced efficacy was significant for live-attenuated influenza vaccine only. Three studies investigated efficacy against ARI in children, with the RR of 0.96 (0.81-1.15). The results on adults and the elderly were scarce. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine efficacy against mismatch strains was lower in repeatedly vaccinated children as compared with those vaccinated for the current season only.

  abstract = {Influenza virus infections are a major public health concern and cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current vaccines are effective but strain specific due to their focus on the immunodominant globular head domain of the hemagglutinin (HA). It has been hypothesized that sequential exposure of humans to hemagglutinins with divergent globular head domains but conserved stalk domains could refocus the immune response to broadly neutralizing epitopes in the stalk. Humans have preexisting immunity against H1 (group 1 hemagglutinin), and vaccination with H5 HA (also group 1)---which has a divergent globular head domain but a similar stalk domain---represents one such sequential-exposure scenario. To test this hypothesis, we used novel reagents based on chimeric hemagglutinins to screen sera from an H5N1 clinical trial for induction of stalk-specific antibodies by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays. Importantly, we also investigated the biological activity of these antibodies in a passive transfer in a mouse challenge model. We found that the H5N1 vaccine induced high titers of stalk-reactive antibodies which were biologically active and protective in the passive-transfer experiment. The induced response showed exceptional breadth toward divergent group 1 hemagglutinins but did not extend to group 2 hemagglutinins. These data provide evidence for the hypothesis that sequential exposure to hemagglutinins with divergent globular head domains but conserved stalk domains can refocus the immune response toward the conserved stalk domain. Furthermore, the results support the concept of a chimeric hemagglutinin universal influenza virus vaccine strategy that is based on the same principle. IMPORTANCE Influenza virus vaccines have to be reformulated and readministered on an annual basis. The development of a universal influenza virus vaccine could abolish the need for this cumbersome and costly process and would also enhance our pandemic preparedness. This study addressed the following questions, which are essential for the development of a hemagglutinin stalk-based universal influenza virus vaccine. (i) Can stalk-reactive antibodies be boosted by vaccination with divergent HAs that share conserved epitopes? (ii) How long-lived are these vaccine-induced stalk-reactive antibody responses? (iii) What is the breadth of this reactivity? (iv) Are these antibodies functional and protective? Our results further strengthen the concept of induction of stalk-reactive antibodies by sequential exposure to hemagglutinin immunogens with conserved stalk and divergent head domains. A universal influenza virus vaccine based on the same principles seems possible and might have a significant impact on global human health.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Background Two important challenges to the use of serological assays for influenza surveillance include the substantial amount of experimental effort involved and the inherent noisiness of serological data. Results I show that log-transformed serological data exist in an effectively one-dimensional space. I use this result, together with new mechanistic insights into serological assays, to develop computational methods for accurately and efficiently recovering unmeasured serological data from a sample of measured data, for systematically minimizing noise and other types of non-antigenic variation found in the data, and for quantifying and visualizing antigenic variation. The methods can also be applied to data with effective dimensionality greater than one, under certain conditions. Conclusion Careful application of the methods developed here would enable the collection of better-quality serological data on a greater number of circulating influenza viruses than is currently possible and improve the ability to identify potential epidemic and pandemic viruses before they become widespread. Although the focus here is on influenza surveillance, the described methods are more widely applicable.},

  abstract = {Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population, can one predict its evolutionary future? Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains. Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds by accumulation of small effect mutations, does not require species specific input and can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure. We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus. We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30\% of cases and make informative predictions in 16 out of 19 years. Beyond providing a tool for prediction, our ability to make informative predictions implies persistent fitness variation among circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03568.001, When viruses multiply, they copy their genetic material to make clones of themselves. However, the genetic material in the clone is often slightly different from the genetic material in the original virus. These mutations can be caused by mistakes made during copying or by radiation or chemicals. Further mutations arise when the clones multiply, which means that, after many generations, there will be quite large differences in the genetic material carried by many members of the population. Most mutations have little or no effect on the `fitness' of an individual - that is, on its ability to survive and multiply - but some mutations do have an influence., Some viruses, like seasonal influenza (flu) viruses, can mutate so rapidly that the most common strains change from year to year. This is why new flu vaccines are needed every year. To date most attempts to predict the evolution of seasonal flu viruses have focused on identifying specific features within the genetic sequences that might indicate fitness. However, such approaches require lots of information about the viruses, and this information is often not available., To address this problem, Neher, Russell and Shraiman have developed a more general method to predict fitness from virus genetic sequences. First, a `family tree' for a virus population - which shows how each strain of the virus is related to other strains - was constructed by comparing the genetic sequences., The next step was based on the observation that as long as differences in fitness arise from the accumulation of multiple mutations, the branching structure of this family tree will bear a visible imprint of the natural selection process as it unfolds. Using this insight and methods borrowed from statistical physics, Neher et al. then analyzed the shape and branching pattern of the tree to work out the fitness of the different strains relative to each other., Neher et al. tested the method using historical influenza A virus data. In 16 of the 19 years studied, the family tree approach made meaningful predictions about which viruses were most likely to give rise to future epidemics. The ability to predict influenza virus evolution from tree shape alone suggests that influenza virus evolution may be more predictable than previously expected., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03568.002},

  abstract = {Most humans have pre-existing immunity to influenza viruses. In this study, volunteers (ages of 18--85 years) were vaccinated with split, inactivated Fluzone™ influenza vaccine in four consecutive influenza seasons from 2013 to 2016 seasons. The impact of repeated vaccination on breadth and durability of antibodies was assessed as a result of vaccine strain changes. Total IgG anti-hemagglutinin (HA) binding antibodies and hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) activity increased in all age groups against both influenza A HA components in the vaccine post-vaccination (day 21). However, younger subjects maintained seroprotective titers to the vaccine strains, which resulted in higher seroconversion rates in the elderly, since the HAI titers in elderly subjects were more likely to decline prior to the next season. Young subjects had significant HAI activity against historical, as well as contemporary H1 and H3 vaccine strains from the mid-1980s to present. In contrast, elderly subjects had HAI activity to H1 strains from all years, but were more likely to have HAI activity to older strains from 1918-1950s. They also had a more restricted HAI profile against H3 viruses compared to young subjects recognizing H3N2 influenza viruses from the mid-2000s to present. Vaccine recipients were then categorized by whether subjects seroconverted from a seronegative or seropositive pre-vaccination state. Regardless of age, immunological recall or `back-boosting' to antigenically related strains were associated with seroconversion to the vaccine strain. Overall, both younger and older people have the ability to mount a breadth of immune responses following influenza vaccination. This report describes how imprinting exposure differs across age groups, influences antibody cross-reactivity to past hemagglutinin antigenic variants, and shapes immune responses elicited by current split inactivated influenza vaccines. Understanding how current influenza vaccines are influenced by pre-existing immunity in people of different ages is critical for designing the next-generation of `universal' or broadly-protective influenza vaccines.},

Methods We systematically searched for full-text publications of VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza from TND studies in outpatient settings after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated pooled adjusted VE across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, using an inverse variance, random-effects model. Results We included 76 full-text articles from 11,931 citations. VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were homogenous and point pooled VE higher in the Southern hemisphere compared with the Northern hemisphere. The difference in pooled VE between the Southern and Northern hemispheres was statistically significant for A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza. A consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across both hemispheres and continents, with the highest point pooled VE being against A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by influenza B, and lowest against A(H3N2). A nearly consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across age groups in the Northern hemisphere, with pooled VE mostly decreasing with age. Point pooled VE against A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were statistically significantly higher when vaccine was antigenically similar to circulating virus strains compared with when antigenically dissimilar. Similar pattern was observed in the Northern hemisphere, but there was a lack of data from the Southern hemisphere. Conclusion Consistent patterns appear to exist in seasonal influenza VE across regions, age groups, and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, with best vaccine performance against A(H1N1)pdm09 and worst against A(H3N2). The evidence highlights the need to consider geographical location, age, and vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains when designing and evaluating influenza VE studies.},

Human influenza epidemics are caused by types A and B, with roughly 25\% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded RNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and vaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high rate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual influenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To predict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected vaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here introduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B vaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with effectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans between 1979 and 2014. We discuss how this measure of antigenic distance may be used in the context of annual influenza vaccine design and prediction of vaccine effectiveness.},

The majority of vaccine viruses are isolated and propagated in eggs, which commonly results in amino acid substitutions in the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. These substitutions can affect virus receptor-binding and alter virus antigenicity, thereby, obfuscating the choice of egg-propagated viruses for development into candidate vaccine viruses. To evaluate the effects of egg-adaptive substitutions seen in H3N2 vaccine viruses on sialic acid receptor-binding, we carried out quantitative measurement of virus receptor-binding using surface biolayer interferometry with haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays to correlate changes in receptor avidity with antigenic properties. Included in these studies was a panel of H3N2 viruses generated by reverse genetics containing substitutions seen in recent egg-propagated vaccine viruses and corresponding cell culture-propagated wild-type viruses. These assays provide a quantitative approach to investigating the importance of individual amino acid substitutions in influenza receptor-binding. Results show that viruses with egg-adaptive HA substitutions R156Q, S219Y, and I226N, have increased binding avidity to {$\alpha$}2,3-linked receptor-analogues and decreased binding avidity to {$\alpha$}2,6-linked receptor-analogues. No measurable binding was detected for the viruses with amino acid substitution combination 156Q+219Y and receptor-binding increased in viruses where egg-adaptation mutations were introduced into cell culture-propagated virus. Substitutions at positions 156 and 190 appeared to be primarily responsible for low reactivity in HI assays with post-infection ferret antisera raised against 2012-2013 season H3N2 viruses. Egg-adaptive substitutions at position 186 caused substantial differences in binding avidity with an insignificant effect on antigenicity.},

  abstract = {Owing to the rapid changes in the antigenicity of influenza viruses, it is difficult for humans to obtain lasting immunity through antiviral therapy. Hence, tracking the dynamic changes in the antigenicity of influenza viruses can provide a basis for vaccines and drug treatments to cope with the spread of influenza viruses. In this paper, we developed a novel quantitative prediction method to predict the antigenic distance between virus strains using attribute network embedding techniques. An antigenic network is built to model and combine the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the influenza A virus H3N2, using the continuous distributed representation of the virus strain protein sequence (ProtVec) as a node attribute and the antigenic distance between virus strains as an edge weight. The results show a strong positive correlation between supplementing genetic features and antigenic distance prediction accuracy. Further analysis indicates that our prediction model can comprehensively and accurately track the differences in antigenic distances between vaccines and influenza virus strains, and it outperforms existing methods in predicting antigenic distances between strains.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses continually evolve new antigenic variants, through mutations in epitopes of their major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Antigenic drift potentiates the reinfection of previously infected individuals, but the contribution of this process to variability in annual epidemics is not well understood. Here, we link influenza A(H3N2) virus evolution to regional epidemic dynamics in the United States during 1997-2019. We integrate phenotypic measures of HA antigenic drift and sequence-based measures of HA and NA fitness to infer antigenic and genetic distances between viruses circulating in successive seasons. We estimate the magnitude, severity, timing, transmission rate, age-specific patterns, and subtype dominance of each regional outbreak and find that genetic distance based on broad sets of epitope sites is the strongest evolutionary predictor of A(H3N2) virus epidemiology. Increased HA and NA epitope distance between seasons correlates with larger, more intense epidemics, higher transmission, greater A(H3N2) subtype dominance, and a greater proportion of cases in adults relative to children, consistent with increased population susceptibility. Based on random forest models, A(H1N1) incidence impacts A(H3N2) epidemics to a greater extent than viral evolution, suggesting that subtype interference is a major driver of influenza A virus infection ynamics, presumably via heterosubtypic cross-immunity.},

Influenza RNA for the analysis was isolated from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue sample prepared during the autopsy of a victim of the influenza pandemic in 1918. Influenza RNA was also isolated from lung tissue samples from two additional victims of the lethal 1918 influenza: one formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sample and one frozen sample obtained by in situ biopsy of the lung of a victim buried in permafrost since 1918. The complete coding sequence of the A/South Carolina/1/18 HA gene was obtained. The HA1 domain sequence was confirmed by using the two additional isolates (A/New York/1/18 and A/Brevig Mission/1/18). The sequences show little variation. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the 1918 virus HA gene, although more closely related to avian strains than any other mammalian sequence, is mammalian and may have been adapting in humans before 1918.},

Antigenic drift is a feature of not only the hemagglutinin (HA), but also of neuraminidase (NA). We have evaluated the antigenic evolution of each protein in H1N1 and H3N2 viruses used in vaccine formulations during the last 15 y by analysis of HA and NA inhibition titers and antigenic cartography. As previously shown for HA, genetic changes in NA did not always lead to an antigenic change. The noncontinuous pattern of NA drift did not correspond closely with HA drift in either subtype. Although NA drift was demonstrated using ferret sera, we show that these changes also impact recognition by NA-inhibiting antibodies in human sera. Remarkably, a single point mutation in the NA of A/Brisbane/59/2007 was primarily responsible for the lack of inhibition by polyclonal antibodies specific for earlier strains. These data underscore the importance of NA inhibition testing to define antigenic drift when there are sequence changes in NA.},

It is also used to determine the need for annual influenza vaccine updates as well as for pandemic preparedness. Performing antigenic characterization of IAV on a global scale is confronted with high costs, animal availability, and other practical challenges. Here we present a machine learning model that accurately predicts (normalized) outputs of HI assays involving circulating human IAV H3N2 viruses, using their hemagglutinin subunit 1 (HA1) sequences and associated metadata. Each season, the model learns an updated nonlinear mapping of genetic to antigenic changes using data from past seasons only. The model accurately distinguishes antigenic variants from non-variants and adaptively characterizes seasonal dynamics of HA1 sites having the strongest influence on antigenic change. Antigenic predictions produced by the model can aid influenza surveillance, public health management, and vaccine strain selection activities. This study presents a machine learning model that accurately predicts seasonal antigenic changes of influenza A H3N2 using genetic data. The model's predictions can aid influenza surveillance, vaccine strain selection, and public health management.},

Antigenic cartography is not only useful in the research of influenza virus evolution but also in the surveillance of influenza viruses. Most importantly, antigenic cartography plays a very important role in vaccine updating decisions, since by calculating the antigenic distances between a vaccine strain and circulating strains, an informed decision can be made on whether the distances are large enough to warrant a vaccine update or not. Recent improvements in antigenic cartography calculations have significantly improved its accuracy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In late spring 2009, concern was raised in Canada that prior vaccination with the 2008-09 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) was associated with increased risk of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (pH1N1) illness. Several epidemiologic investigations were conducted through the summer to assess this putative association. STUDIES INCLUDED: (1) test-negative case-control design based on Canada's sentinel vaccine effectiveness monitoring system in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec; (2) conventional case-control design using population controls in Quebec; (3) test-negative case-control design in Ontario; and (4) prospective household transmission (cohort) study in Quebec. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios for TIV effect on community- or hospital-based laboratory-confirmed seasonal or pH1N1 influenza cases compared to controls with restriction, stratification, and adjustment for covariates including combinations of age, sex, comorbidity, timeliness of medical visit, prior physician visits, and/or health care worker (HCW) status. For the prospective study risk ratios were computed. Based on the sentinel study of 672 cases and 857 controls, 2008-09 TIV was associated with statistically significant protection against seasonal influenza (odds ratio 0.44, 95\% CI 0.33-0.59). In contrast, estimates from the sentinel and three other observational studies, involving a total of 1,226 laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases and 1,505 controls, indicated that prior receipt of 2008-09 TIV was associated with increased risk of medically attended pH1N1 illness during the spring-summer 2009, with estimated risk or odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. Risk of pH1N1 hospitalization was not further increased among vaccinated people when comparing hospitalized to community cases. CONCLUSIONS: Prior receipt of 2008-09 TIV was associated with increased risk of medically attended pH1N1 illness during the spring-summer 2009 in Canada. The occurrence of bias (selection, information) or confounding cannot be ruled out. Further experimental and epidemiological assessment is warranted. Possible biological mechanisms and immunoepidemiologic implications are considered.},

As a randomized-controlled trial, their crude estimate of the risk ratio (RR\,=\,2.58) among randomized participants is conceptually the most valid. Surprisingly, that primary finding is conveyed in neither their manuscript title nor in the commentary by Glezen [1, 2]. Cowling et al instead draw inconsistent conclusions by combining the 119 randomized children with 312 nonrandomized household contacts (Table 6 [1]). This approach seems inappropriate given that 77\% of household contacts were \&gt;15 years old (Table 1 [1])---an age group not included in randomized subjects and in whom the pH1N1 attack rate was lower (Table 7 [1])---thereby diluting findings in the randomized children with noncomparable and mostly (90\%) nonvaccinated adults (Table 1 [1]).},

The antigenic distance hypothesis (ADH) predicts that negative interference from prior season's influenza vaccine (v1) on the current season's vaccine (v2) protection may occur when the antigenic distance is small between v1 and v2 (v1 {$\approx$} v2) but large between v1 and the current epidemic (e) strain (v1 {$\neq$} e). Methods. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2) illness was estimated by test-negative design during 3 A(H3N2) epidemics (2010--2011, 2012--2013, 2014--2015) in Canada. Vaccine effectiveness was derived with covariate adjustment across v2 and/or v1 categories relative to no vaccine receipt among outpatients aged {$\geq$}9 years. Prior vaccination effects were interpreted within the ADH framework. Results. Prior vaccination effects varied significantly by season, consistent with the ADH. There was no interference by v1 in 2010--2011 when v1 {$\neq$} v2 and v1 {$\neq$} e, with comparable VE for v2 alone or v2 + v1: 34\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = -51\% to 71\%) versus 34\% (95\% CI = -5\% to 58\%). Negative interference by v1 was suggested in 2012--2013 with nonsignificant reduction in VE when v1 {$\approx$} v2 and v1 {$\neq$} e: 49\% (95\% CI = -47\% to 83\%) versus 28\% (95\% CI = -12\% to 54\%). Negative effects of prior vaccination were pronounced and statistically significant in 2014--2015 when v1 {$\equiv$} v2 and v1 {$\neq$} e: 65\% (95\% CI = 25\% to 83\%) versus -33\% (95\% CI = -78\% to 1\%). Conclusions. Effects of repeat influenza vaccination were consistent with the ADH and may have contributed to findings of low VE across recent A(H3N2) epidemics since 2010 in Canada.},

On sequencing these genome segments, we found single amino acid replacements at amino acid 47 of the HA2 subunit of the hemagglutinin and at amino acid 139 of the matrix protein. Mutation was not detected in segments 5 and 8, obviating a role for these genes in FM-MA virulence. FM-MA replicates to higher titer than FM in MDCK cells and in mouse lung. FM X FM-MA reassortants were used to show that the M1 gene controlled replication in MDCK cells as well as in mouse lung.},

  abstract = {Conclusions have differed in studies that have compared vaccine efficacy in groups receiving influenza vaccine for the first time to efficacy in groups vaccinated more than once. For example, the Hoskins study [Hoskins, T. W., Davis, J. R., Smith, A. J., Miller, C. L. \& Allchin, A. (1979) Lancet i, 33--35] concluded that repeat vaccination was not protective in the long term, whereas the Keitel study [Keitel, W. A., Cate, T. R., Couch, R. B., Huggins, L. L. \& Hess, K. R. (1997) Vaccine 15, 1114--1122] concluded that repeat vaccination provided continual protection. We propose an explanation, the antigenic distance hypothesis, and test it by analyzing seven influenza outbreaks that occurred during the Hoskins and Keitel studies. The hypothesis is that variation in repeat vaccine efficacy is due to differences in antigenic distances among vaccine strains and between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strain in each outbreak. To test the hypothesis, antigenic distances were calculated from historical hemagglutination inhibition assay tables, and a computer model of the immune response was used to predict the vaccine efficacy of individuals given different vaccinations. The model accurately predicted the observed vaccine efficacies in repeat vaccinees relative to the efficacy in first-time vaccinees (correlation 0.87). Thus, the antigenic distance hypothesis offers a parsimonious explanation of the differences between and within the Hoskins and Keitel studies. These results have implications for the selection of influenza vaccine strains, and also for vaccination strategies for other antigenically variable pathogens that might require repeated vaccination.},

The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite decades of research on the influenza virus, we still lack a predictive understanding of how vaccination reshapes each person's antibody response, which impedes efforts to design better vaccines. Models using pre-vaccination antibody haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titres against the vaccine strain alone poorly predict post-vaccination responses. METHODS: We combined fifteen prior H3N2 influenza vaccine studies from 1997 to 2021, collectively containing 20,000 data points, and develop of a machine learning model that uses pre-vaccination HAI titres against multiple influenza variants to predict post-vaccination responses. To further test the model, four new vaccine studies were conducted in 2022-2023 spanning two geographic locations and three influenza vaccine types. FINDINGS: The most predictive pre-vaccination features were HAI titres against the vaccine strain and against historical influenza variants, with smaller predictive power derived from age, sex, vaccine dose, and geographic location. The resulting model predicted future responses even when the vaccine strain or vaccine formulation changed. A pre-vaccination feature-the time between peak HAI across recent variants-distinguished large versus small post-vaccination responses with 73\% accuracy. Model predictions against prior vaccine studies had 2.4-fold error (95\% CI: 2.34-2.40x, no large outliers with {$>$}4-fold error), yielding more accurate and robust predictions than a null model with 3.2-fold error (95\% CI: 3.12-3.21x, 12\% large outliers). The four new vaccine studies presented here were predicted with comparable accuracy to the intrinsic 2-fold error of the experimental assay. INTERPRETATION: A person's pre-vaccination influenza HAI titres using multiple variants are highly predictive of their post-vaccination response. Many individuals exhibited little-to-no vaccine response, as exhibited by the null model's accuracy, yet the machine learning model identified and accurately predicted both weak and strong responses with statistical superiority. Taken together, this approach paves the way to better utilise current influenza vaccines, especially for individuals that exhibit the weakest responses.

Baseline sera were available for 595 HCW in 2020 and 1031 in 2021. 5\% had not been vaccinated during five years prior to enrolment and 55\% had been vaccinated every year. Post-vaccination titres for all vaccine antigens were lowest among HCW vaccinated in all 5-prior years and highest among HCW with 0 or 1 prior vaccinations, even after adjustment.

  abstract = {The influenza A virus hemagglutinin protein (HA) has been studied extensively in humans but less so in other host species. Here, we compared the rates of nucleotide substitution, protein evolution, and glycosylation in the H1 and H3 head and stalk domains among five host classes (avian, canine, equine, human, and swine). For further resolution, we separately analyzed 49 lineages differentiated by host and geography. HA evolution in non-human hosts was more dynamic than expected. For example, the classical swine H1 head domain accumulated glycosylation sites in the antigenically important head domain at a rate as high as in humans. However, whereas the stalk domain was highly conserved in humans, with a low ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes, this ratio was approximately 2.5-fold higher in canines. Together, these findings highlight the need for further study of HA evolution in non-human hosts.IMPORTANCEFor decades, researchers have studied the rapid evolution of influenza A viruses for vaccine design and as a useful model system for the study of host/parasite evolution. By performing an exhaustive analysis of hemagglutinin protein (HA) sequences from 49 lineages independently evolving in birds, swine, canines, equines, and humans over the last century, our work uncovers surprising features of HA evolution. In particular, the canine H3 stalk, unlike human H3 and H1 stalk domains, is not evolving slowly, suggesting that evolution in the stalk domain is not universally constrained across all host species. Therefore, a broader multi-host perspective on HA evolution may be useful during the evaluation and design of stalk-targeted vaccine candidates.

Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models.

  abstract = {The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is an established technique for assessing influenza immunity, through measurement of antihemagglutinin antibodies. Improved reproducibility of this assay is required to provide meaningful data across different testing laboratories. This study assessed the impact of harmonizing the HAI assay protocol/reagents and using standards on interlaboratory variability. Human pre- and postvaccination sera from individuals (n\,=\,30) vaccinated against influenza were tested across six laboratories. We used a design of experiment (DOE) method to evaluate the impact of assay parameters on interlaboratory HAI assay variability. Statistical and mathematical approaches were used for data analysis. We developed a consensus protocol and assessed its performance against in-house HAI testing. We additionally tested the performance of several potential biological standards. In-house testing with four reassortant viruses showed considerable interlaboratory variation (geometric coefficient of variation [GCV] range of 50\% to 117\%). The age, concentration of turkey red blood cells, incubation duration, and temperature were key assay parameters affecting variability. Use of a consensus protocol with common reagents, including viruses, significantly reduced GCV between laboratories to 22\% to 54\%. Pooled postvaccination human sera from different vaccination campaigns were effective as biological standards. Our results demonstrate that the harmonization of protocols and critical reagents is effective in reducing interlaboratory variability in HAI assay results and that pools of postvaccination human sera have potential as biological standards that can be used over multiple vaccination campaigns. Moreover, the use of standards together with in-house protocols is as potent as the use of common protocols and reagents in reducing interlaboratory variability. IMPORTANCE The hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay is the most commonly used serology assay to detect antibodies from influenza vaccination or influenza virus infection. This assay has been used for decades but requires improved standardization of procedures to provide meaningful data. We designed a large study to assess selected parameters for their contribution to assay variability and developed a standard protocol to promote consistent HAI testing methods across laboratories. The use of this protocol and common reagents resulted in lower levels of variability in results between participating laboratories than achieved using in-house HAI testing. Human sera sourced from vaccination campaigns over several years, and thus including antibody to different influenza vaccine strains, served as effective assay standards. Based on our findings, we recommend the use of a common protocol and/or human serum standards, if available, for testing human sera for the presence of antibodies against seasonal influenza using turkey red blood cells.},

  abstract = {Antigenic characterization of emerging and re-emerging viruses is necessary for the prevention of and response to outbreaks, evaluation of infection mechanisms, understanding of virus evolution, and selection of strains for vaccine development. Primary analytic methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent/lectin assays, hemagglutination inhibition, neuraminidase inhibition, micro-neutralization assays, and antigenic cartography, have been widely used in the field of influenza research. These techniques have been improved upon over time for increased analytical capacity, and some have been mobilized for the rapid characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as its variants, facilitating the development of highly effective vaccines within 1 year of the initially reported outbreak. While great strides have been made for evaluating the antigenic properties of these viruses, multiple challenges prevent efficient vaccine strain selection and accurate assessment. For influenza, these barriers include the requirement for a large virus quantity to perform the assays, more than what can typically be provided by the clinical samples alone, cell- or egg-adapted mutations that can cause antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and circulating viruses, and up to a 6-month duration of vaccine development after vaccine strain selection, which allows viruses to continue evolving with potential for antigenic drift and, thus, antigenic mismatch between the vaccine strain and the emerging epidemic strain. SARS-CoV-2 characterization has faced similar challenges with the additional barrier of the need for facilities with high biosafety levels due to its infectious nature. In this study, we review the primary analytic methods used for antigenic characterization of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the barriers of these methods and current developments for addressing these challenges.},

  abstract = {Influenza viruses evolve their antigenic phenotype in response to immune-driven selection, necessitating regular updates to the antigens used in influenza vaccines. Characterising antigenic change of influenza virus currently requires intensive serology-based laboratory work to analyse the movements of viruses in antigenic space. By contrast, pathogen genomics can generate large numbers of sequences in near real-time. However, using genetic sequences to predict antigenic changes remains challenging due to the complex relationship between genetic and antigenic changes. Here we develop a deep learning approach to predict the antigenic distance between influenza H3N2 viruses using 83,145 hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. We first train an elementary protein language model to encode the HA sequences, and then couple the trained language model with a deep regression model to realise the sequence-based prediction. Our method provides stable and accurate prediction on the antigenic distance between H3N2 viruses using their HA sequences. This facilitates the prediction of antigenic movements of viruses in each influenza season using their sequence data. Our sequence-based method will enable real-time prediction of influenza antigenic changes and support vaccine strain selection.},

  abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2{$\lambda$}/n, where {$\lambda$} is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

However, we have a limited understanding of how the antigenic effects of viral mutations vary across the human population and how this heterogeneity affects virus evolution. Here, we use deep mutational scanning to map how mutations to the hem- agglutinin (HA) proteins of two H3N2 strains, A/Hong Kong/45/2019 and A/Perth/16/2009, affect neutralization by serum from individuals of a variety of ages. The effects of HA mutations on serum neutralization differ across age groups in ways that can be partially rationalized in terms of exposure histories. Mutations that were fixed in influenza variants after 2020 cause greater escape from sera from younger individuals compared with adults. Overall, these results demonstrate that influenza faces distinct antigenic selection regimes from different age groups and suggest approaches to understand how this heterogeneous selection shapes viral evolution.},

Head-to-head comparison between ferret and human antisera derived antigenic maps revealed different antigenic patterns among representative egg- and cell-grown H3 viruses characterized. Molecular modeling indicated that the mutations of epidemic H3 strains were mainly located in antibody-binding sites A and B as compared with TX/12e.

Antibody profiles can be generated by characterizing immune responses to multiple antigenically variant strains, but how these profiles vary across individuals and determine future responses is unclear. We used hemagglutination inhibition titers from 21 H3N2 strains to construct 777 paired antibody profiles from people aged 2 to 86, and developed novel metrics to capture features of these profiles. Total antibody titer per potential influenza exposure increases in early life, then decreases in middle age. Increased titers to one or more strains were seen in 97.8\% of participants during a roughly four-year interval, suggesting widespread influenza exposure. While titer changes were seen to all strains, recently circulating strains exhibited the greatest titer rise. Higher pre-existing, homologous titers at baseline reduced the risk of seroconversion to recent strains. After adjusting for homologous titer, we also found an increased frequency of seroconversion against recent strains among those with higher immunity to older previously exposed strains. Including immunity to previously exposures also improved the deviance explained by the models. Our results suggest that a comprehensive quantitative description of immunity encompassing past exposures could lead to improved correlates of risk of influenza infection.},

Duplicate precision and reproducibility from comparisons between assays within laboratories were 99.8\% (99.2\% to 100\%) and 98.0\% (93.3\% to 100\%), respectively. The results for 98.9\% (95\% to 100\%) of the samples were within 2-fold of all-laboratory consensus titers, and the results for 94.3\% (85\% to 100\%) of the samples were within 2-fold of our reference laboratory data. Low-titer samples showed the greatest variability in comparisons between assays and between sites. Classification of seroprotection (titer {$\geq$} 40) was accurate in 93.6\% or 89.5\% of cases in comparison to the consensus or reference laboratory classification, respectively.

  abstract = {The development of next-generation influenza vaccines that elicit strain-transcendent immunity against both seasonal and pandemic viruses is a key public health goal. Targeting the evolutionarily conserved epitopes on the stem of influenza's major surface molecule, hemagglutinin, is an appealing prospect, and novel vaccine formulations show promising results in animal model systems. However, studies in humans indicate that natural infection and vaccination result in limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA, and the level of stem-specific antibody elicited is insufficient to provide broad strain-transcendent immunity. Here, we use mathematical models of the humoral immune response to explore how pre-existing immunity affects the ability of vaccines to boost antibodies to the head and stem of HA in humans, and, in particular, how it leads to the apparent lack of boosting of broadly cross-reactive antibodies to the stem epitopes. We consider hypotheses where binding of antibody to an epitope: (i) results in more rapid clearance of the antigen; (ii) leads to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes which inhibit B cell activation through Fc{$\gamma$} receptor-mediated mechanism; and (iii) masks the epitope and prevents the stimulation and proliferation of specific B cells. We find that only epitope masking but not the former two mechanisms to be key in recapitulating patterns in data. We discuss the ramifications of our findings for the development of vaccines against both seasonal and pandemic influenza., The current influenza vaccine requires frequent updating in order to protect against small changes in the virus from one year to the next as well as larger changes associated with the emergence of new influenza strains from zoonotic reservoirs that cause pandemics. There is a considerable interest in developing ``universal'' vaccines that will boost immune responses to the conserved regions of the virus, in particular, to the stem region of the major virus surface molecule hemagglutinin (HA). However, recent data reveals that vaccination results in very limited boosting of antibodies to the stem of HA. We use mathematical models to explore different hypotheses that may explain why vaccination does not boost antibodies to the conserved parts of the virus. By confronting our models with the data from the human vaccination trials we found that the key mechanism preventing effective boosting of the responses to the stem of HA is masking of the stem by pre-existing antibodies developed during previous infections and vaccinations. We discuss how this masking effect could be overcome in a ``universal'' influenza vaccine.},

  abstract = {Influenza A (H3N2) offers a well-studied, yet not fully understood, disease in terms of the interactions between pathogen population dynamics, epidemiology and genetics. A major open question is why the virus population is globally dominated by a single and very recently diverged (2--8 years) lineage. Classically, this has been modeled by limiting the generation of new successful antigenic variants, such that only a small subset of progeny acquire the necessary mutations to evade host immunity. An alternative approach was recently suggested by Recker et al. in which a limited number of antigenic variants are continuously generated, but most of these are suppressed by pre-existing host population immunity. Here we develop a framework spanning the regimes described above to explore the impact of rates of mutation and levels of competition on phylodynamic patterns. We find that the evolutionary dynamics of the subtype H3N2 influenza is most easily generated within this framework when it is mutation limited as well as being under strong immune selection at a number of epitope regions of limited diversity.},
