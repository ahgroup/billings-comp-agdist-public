"Study-320_antigenic_dist","Sequence-based antigenic distance metrics generate similar predictions of vaccine breadth to antigenic distance metrics from cartography when used for modeling, even though the different distance metrics have low reliability.","Compute cartographic distances using the HAI titer matrix from the UGAFluVac data, along with multiple sequence based distances. Calculate the reliability across measurements, and then generate computational models to predict vaccine-induced immunogenicity at multiple levels of antigenic distance, for each distance metric.","Pre and post-vaccination HAI titer measurements to Fluzone SD and HD vaccine to homologous strains and a panel of historical strains.","Not Provided","12","84","Years","2024-11-04","Vaccine Response","Not Applicable","Handelgroup_BayesModel","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","Not Applicable","Not Applicable"
